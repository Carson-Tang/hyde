And so it begins...

I decided to start a blog --- inspired by a few friends who have blogs of their own, I thought it would be fun to track down my thoughts, experiences and things I have learned. Thinking back to the blogs of my friends when I first saw their websites, until I started becoming interested in writing blogs myself, I hadn't actually read through the blogs they had posted. So, I think to myself now, is anyone actually going to read these? Regardless, it would also be quite interesting to read these again in the future.

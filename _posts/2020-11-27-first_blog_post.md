And so it begins...

I decided to start a blog --- inspired by a few friends who have blogs of their own, I thought it would be fun to track down my thoughts, experiences and things I have learned. Thinking back to seeing the blogs of my friends, I never read through any of the blogs they had posted first saw their websites until I started becoming interested in writing blogs myself. So, I wonder --- is anyone actually going to read these? Regardless, it would also be quite interesting to read these again in the future.

Hey there!
I'm Carson and online you can typically find me under the handle `Pooks`.

I'm a second year <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student studying at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong>.

In the winter, I will be working @ <ins>[Dropbase \| YC W20](https://www.dropbase.io/)</ins>, working on PostgREST microservices and Pandas to DB mapping. 

Previously, I interned at

* <ins>[Sheertex](https://www.sheertex.com/)</ins> \| April 2020 - August 2020, building a scalable model on discrete events using [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to optimize and automate the production workflow, and developing in-house tools.

On my free time, I help maintain the <ins>[DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)</ins>, Canada's largest online judge and open-source programming platform, and learning about different algorithms.

I also enjoy discovering new music, watching anime, reading manga, playing chess, solving different types of Rubik Cubes and following the Dota 2 scene.

If you have any recommendations, interesting reads, or just wanna chat, feel free to reach out and send me a message to my email or add `Pooks #1001` on Discord!
